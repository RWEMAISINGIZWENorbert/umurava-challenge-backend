# Umurava Challenge Backend API

A robust RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB for managing all types of challenges (not just coding) and user authentication. This backend powers the Umurava Challenge platform, enabling users to register, log in, and participate in a variety of challenges, while providing admins with tools to manage challenges and users securely.

## ðŸš€ Features

- User registration and authentication (JWT-based)
- Admin and talent user roles
- Secure password hashing (bcryptjs)
- Challenge CRUD operations
- Challenge status automation (via cron jobs)
- Role-based access control (middleware)
- CORS and cookie management
- Environment-based configuration

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **MongoDB** (via Mongoose)
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing
- **dotenv** for environment variables
- **node-cron** for scheduled tasks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd umurava-challenge-backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set DB_URL, SECRET_KEY_ACCESS_TOKEN, etc.
```

### Running the Server

```bash
